<h2 id="what-is-elm">What is Elm?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Language (and “framework”) for building web frontend applications</li>
<li>Can be used in place of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li>Compiles into the above</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-choose-elm">Why choose Elm?</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-javascript">The problem with JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basically nobody knows all of JavaScript - in fact it is getting more and more complex each year</li>
<li>Different people have very different ways of using the language (object-oriented, functional, this-less, …)</li>
<li>With JavaScript, anything may suddenly fail in production because of an oversight</li>
<li>Nothing can save you from that (except maybe boatloads of menial tests: what if this function is called without arguments, with an empty array…)</li>
<li>It takes a great deal of discipline to keep code readable and adhere to the project’s code style</li>
<li>Huge potential for regressions when refactoring</li>
<li>Every project has a wildly different build scheme since there is no “official” or even generally settled-upon toolchain</li>
<li>It is common for builds to break because a library was updated</li>
</ul>
<p>➡️ JavaScript is unwieldy in big projects</p>
<p>➡️ JavaScript is in fact poorly suited for lean development, because refactoring is risky</p>
<h3 id="how-elm-solves-it">How Elm solves it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elm is a simple and compact language</li>
<li>It does not have the baggage of JavaScript’s history</li>
<li>Past releases have made it simpler and simpler - they removing language features that cause confusion</li>
<li>It has a great type system that helps model data and application states
<ul>
<li>This can be used to eliminate an entire category of bugs: arriving in impossible states</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the code compiles, it is correct (can still have logic errors, of course)</li>
<li>Elm has no <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code></li>
<li>Elm has no runtime exceptions except for <code>Debug.crash</code></li>
<li>All potential cases need to be handled - no surprises or unhandled errors, guaranteed!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Using TypeScript or Flow can give some of the benefits, but many libraries’ typings will still non-exhaustive)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Elm enforces writing code in a single paradigm and style (functional, no mutable state)</li>
<li>It comes with great tooling out of the box</li>
<li>Builds can never break because of library updates, because semantic versioning is ensured by the package manager</li>
</ul>
<p>➡️ Elm is very well suited for lean development, because refactoring Elm is fun and we can do it with confidence!</p>
<h3 id="but-a-new-language-surely-its-an-additional-cost">But a new language, surely it’s an additional cost!</h3>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript projects use a combination of e.g. React, Redux, redux-loop, etc.</li>
<li>They might even be using TypeScript or Flow, which are languages with great improvements over plain JS
<ul>
<li>But they build on top of JS, and as said, basically no one knows even all of JavaScript</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is very likely no other project with the exact same libraries and/or code style
<ul>
<li>New dev in a JS project needs at least a week or two to learn the project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Elm is a small language
<ul>
<li>It takes a couple of weeks to be productive</li>
<li>About a month or two to master all of it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Elm compiler is the state of the art when it comes to <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants">friendly error messages</a></li>
<li>All Elm projects follow the same general pattern, because the language doesn’t allow anything else</li>
<li>Elm code is easy to read as it communicates intentions well</li>
<li>New dev can’t inadvertently mess up an Elm project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-the-language-development-is-discontinued-in-a-year">What if the language development is discontinued in a year</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even if the language development was discontinued today, it would be fine</li>
<li>There’s no reason why a project couldn’t be using an older version of Elm for years to come</li>
<li>JS as a compile target is solid, because all old JS code will continue to work in browsers also in the future. (One JavaScript (1JS) principle)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-choose-elm-and-when-not-to">When to choose Elm and when not to</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-elm-a-poor-fit-for">What is Elm a poor fit for</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mostly static pages (e.g. news websites)</li>
<li>Very short projects where you actually want to use ready-made UI components (e.g. MVP admin UIs)</li>
<li>Lots of integration with terrible third-party JavaScript (advertisements in particular)</li>
<li>Sites that need server-side rendering</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Also worth remembering, it can’t be used to build a backend</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-elm-great-for">What is Elm great for</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single page applications</li>
<li>Bespoke design</li>
<li>Longer project (&gt; 2 months)</li>
<li>Especially helpful for bigger frontend teams</li>
</ul>
