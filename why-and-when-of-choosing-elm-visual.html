This is a quick overview of why and when you should consider choosing Elm over JavaScript.
</p>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<details> <summary>What is Elm?</summary>
<ul>
<li>
Elm is a language (and “framework”) for building web frontend applications
</li>
<li>
Can be used in place of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and compiles into them
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/why-when-elm/why-03.jpg" />

</div>
<details> <summary>JS gets more complex, Elm gets simpler</summary>
<ul>
<li>
The amount of features, or the “API surface”, of JavaScript grows all the time
</li>
<li>
Elm’s API surface is much much smaller to begin with, and it’s actually been shrinking the past few releases
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/why-when-elm/why-04.jpg" />

</div>
<details> <summary>(Summary of the table)</summary>
<ul>
<li>
Elm <strong>does not</strong> have <code>this</code>, <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code>, runtime exceptions or multiple paradigms
</li>
<li>
Elm <strong>does</strong> have guarantees of correctness, settled-upon tooling and great ease of refactoring
</li>
<li>
JavaScript has the opposite
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/why-when-elm/why-05.jpg" />

</div>
<details> <summary>Lean development is continuous refactoring</summary>
<ul>
<li>
The features on the previous picture, especially the fickleness of refactoring and lack of guarantees, leads to the fact that JavaScript is in fact poorly suited for lean development
</li>
<li>
Elm, on the other hand, is a dream to work with when the requirements change and the software needs to be adapted
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/why-when-elm/why-06.jpg" />

</div>
<details> <summary>Learning a completely new language may sound like a huge investment, but:</summary>
<ul>
<li>
JavaScript is not a very well defined area of expertise. There’s TypeScript, Flow, React, Vue.js, Angular, plus the build tools
</li>
<li>
Essentially every a JavaScript project is a unique combination of libraries and design decisions
</li>
<li>
Take at least 1-2 weeks for new developers to familiarize themselves with
</li>
<li>
Elm takes about 2 weeks for new developers to get productive with
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<details> <summary>Elm has incredible upsides</summary>
<ul>
<li>
Even a newcomer is not likely to inadvertently mess up a codebase, because the language has such strong guarantees
</li>
<li>
A superb compiler that tells what the problem in my code is, and often suggests how to fix it
</li>
<li>
The code is very easy to read, and it always follows the same general pattern
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/why-when-elm/why-08.jpg" />

</div>
<details> <summary>What about the “bus factor”, what if Elm’s development was dropped?</summary>
<ul>
<li>
We’d be fine using the current version of Elm for the foreseeable future
</li>
<li>
The committee behind JavaScript specifications have the “One JavaScript” principle, which basically means “everything that has been introduced to JavaScript, stays in JavaScript”
</li>
<li>
There is no reason why you’d <strong>need</strong> the new JavaScript features, and if you want to, you can call that from Elm
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/why-when-elm/why-09.jpg" />

</div>
<details> <summary>Elm is a poor fit for things like</summary>
<ul>
<li>
Mostly static pages (e.g. news websites)
</li>
<li>
Very short projects where you actually want to use ready-made UI components (e.g. MVP admin UIs)
</li>
<li>
Lots of integration with terrible third-party JavaScript (advertisements in particular)
</li>
<li>
Sites that need page-by-page visibility in search engines
</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<details> <summary>Elm is great for</summary>
<ul>
<li>
Single page applications
</li>
<li>
Bespoke design
</li>
<li>
Longer project (&gt; 2 months)
</li>
<li>
Especially helpful for bigger frontend teams
</li>
</ul>
